My personal website built with Gatsby, Strapi and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of `Node.js`

## Installing

To install dependencies, `cd` into `client` and `cms` and type `npm install` into your terminal for both directories.

## Using the website

First use the command `npm run develop` in the `cms` folder and then `npm start` in `client`. Order matters!

By default, this version of Strapi uses MongoDB and connects to `localhost:1337`.
